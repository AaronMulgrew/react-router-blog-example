A custom React Router Single Page Application, which is an example for a blog site. 

I could not find any react router SPA's that were a blog, so I created my own.

This is based on the website at mulgrew.me

*How to run*
simply navigate to the directory in the command prompt and type:
npm install
npm start

to build an optimised production build, type:
npm run build
